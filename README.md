# MobileAdTrackers
Taken from DNS logs, formatted in hostfile and other formats.

Caveat: This will also block game reward systems like Tapjoy (i.e. watch videos and play other games for points)

To give you an idea of why we need better mobile ad lists take a look at **[Marketing Technology Landscape Supergraphic - Martec](https://chiefmartec.com/2018/04/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2018/)**.  Each year they release a new poster and you can see the growth of the mobile marketing landscape over the past several years.  Most host-based blocklists do not target mobile ad networks- possibly because they monitor desktop and desktop browser traffic.  Adaway for Android has a built-in hostfile of mobile ad networks but [it hasn't been updated](https://github.com/AdAway/adaway.github.io/commits/master/hosts.txt) since 2016.  The last attempt was by me and it was reverted as I had mistakenly included URL shortener goo.gl.

This list is a heck of a lot more scrutinized than Adaway's as I log from my device and always see what apps are doing out of curiousity.  Not only that, someone used a utility called Funceble that checks host files for dead hosts and approx. [41% of the Adaway list](https://github.com/AdAway/adaway.github.io/pull/8) - a list designed to target mobile ad networks - no longer exist.  I criticize only because you're still letting through what you wanted to prevent.  The other popular lists out there are fine for blocking desktop and browser-based ad networks but I rarely see those domains and subdomains get hit by mobile apps unless they are a web browser app or the app is essentially a webpage packaged as an app.

Tools and other people interested in Android mobile privacy efforts.  If a couple look interesting or familiar the rest you will like as well:

|Utilities & Resources|
|---|
|[Koodous](https://koodous.com/apks) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koodous.android),[Github](https://github.com/Koodous) Community-driven apk analysis + app that scans your apps for malware they've detected|
|[Exodus Privacy](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/) - [Github](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy) France gave a privacy grant to these guys.  They have an app and a site.  I've submitted about domains and dug up the sdk information for about 20 or so companies from this very host file|
|[Yale Privacy Lab](https://privacylab.yale.edu) - [Github](https://github.com/YalePrivacyLab) Buddies with the Exodus Privacy project|
|[Data Transparency Lab](http://datatransparencylab.org) Fund several data privacy projects on this list.|
|[Lumen Privacy Monitor (formerly Project Haystack) - ICSI UC Berkeley](https://www.haystack.mobi/) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.berkeley.icsi.haystack) Research project that made an app.  The app is novel because it is a local VPN that has you install a self-signed SSL certificate so it can decrypt encrypted traffic.  The traffic never leaves your device but what it does is scan all traffic for personally identifiable information.|
|[Protect My Privacy(PMP) - Carnegie Mellon/Synergy Labs](http://www.android.protectmyprivacy.org) - [XPosed Repo](http://repo.xposed.info/module/org.synergylabs.pmpandroid) - Reasearch Project that kinda works but it's screwy when trying to control 3rd party library data independent of the host app. I like the idea, though: pass valid data to the host app but the 3rd party gets junk.  In theory.|
|[Recon - Northeastern University](https://recon.meddle.mobi) - another DTL grant project|
|[AntMonitor - UC Irvine](http://antmonitor.calit2.uci.edu) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.uci.calit2.anteatermo), [YouTube presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fymI9uM7TFo) - another DTL grant project. Similar to Lumen Privacy Monitor but very optimized.|
|[NetGuard](https://www.netguard.me/) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard),[Github](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard) - One of the best traffic blockers for Android.  Also does host file blocklist blocking.  First, it's logging functions are one of the reasons I can make this host file.  Another thing it uniquely does is let you block one app from hitting a domain.  I can block facebook traffic from all apps but leave the Facebook app traffic alone.  That way Facebook can still be a social network for me but not an ad company.|
|[XprivacyLua/Pro](https://lua.xprivacy.eu/) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.xlua.pro),[Xposed Repo](http://repo.xposed.info/module/eu.faircode.xlua),[Github](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyLua) XPosed Module to hook into Android to pass fake data and identifiers to apps instead of what they try to get.  Groundbreaking.|
|Dexplorer - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dexplorer) - lets you inspect an app on-device.  I find myself installing it frequently to see what 3rd party companies they have embedded in an app.|
|My Android Tools(Pro) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.wq.myandroidtoolspro) dead link (I assume Google kicked them off because their app let you view and disable services, receivers, activities and content providers). find the free version on [apkmirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/wangqi/my-android-tools/)|
|[Inspeckage - Package Inspector](http://ac-pm.github.io/Inspeckage/) - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.acpm.inspeckage),[XPosed Repo](http://repo.xposed.info/module/mobi.acpm.inspeckage),[Github](https://github.com/ac-pm/Inspeckage) One of the craziest XPosed modules out there.  Like sets up a web server on your device to let you inspect all sorts of junk from your computer.|
|[PyFunceble](https://funilrys.github.io/PyFunceble/) - [Github](https://github.com/funilrys/PyFunceble) Every hostfile maintainer should use this to validate their lists.  Companies close up shop all the time so having a huge hostfile of down sites makes no sense.|
|[OpenWPM - Princeton Web Transparency & Accountability Project](https://webtap.princeton.edu) - [Github](https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM) - Let's you automate Firefox to visit a bunch of sites.  Could use it to train Privacy Badger or something|
|[FilterLists.com](https://filterlists.com) - [Github](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists) A list of most every hostfile, IP blocklist, and AdBlock Plus syntax blocklist out there. Even the dumb ones. You'd think we could cooperate.|

I put a GPL license on it.  I didn't read the fine print but I'm not liable for damage, let me know if I'm in trouble for anything so I can fix whatever the problem is and not be in trouble, and if you use anything from it let me know so I can feel happy for helping someone.
